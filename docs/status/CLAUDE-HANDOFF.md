# Claude Handoff

Last Updated: 2026-03-05 (KST)
Branch: `main`
Baseline commit: `4c976d6`

## Current Snapshot
- All backend API routes implemented (12 endpoints):
  - MVP: projects CRUD, generate, export, usage
  - Assets: image upload with BYOI validation, BGM upload with analysis
  - Cuts: handoff with preserveOriginal lock
  - Remotion: preview, render, status (stubs)
- Services: byoi-validator (format/size/dimensions), bgm-analyzer (duration gate)
- Status transitions verified: draft → generating → generated → exported.
- UsageLedger records on generate, export, render.
- `next build` and `tsc --noEmit` pass cleanly.
- **UI screens blocked on designer reference.**
- Product flow and wireframe are fixed for:
  - node main editor
  - BYOI path
  - BGM analysis gate
  - Remotion preview/render

## Canonical Docs (Read in Order)
1. `docs/ref/WIREFRAME-NODE-BYOI.md`
2. `docs/ref/USER-FLOW.md`
3. `docs/ref/SCHEMA-INDEX.md`
4. `docs/status/FEATURE-MATRIX.md`
5. `docs/status/PROJECT-STATUS.md`

## Immediate Build Queue
1. ~~Bootstrap runtime~~ — Done
- Next.js + TypeScript + Prisma + SQLite running locally.
- Single-workspace guard implemented (`src/lib/workspace-guard.ts`).

2. ~~Implement data model~~ — Done
- 9 Prisma models with `Asset.sourceType` and `preserveOriginal` fields.

3. ~~Implement API layer~~ — Done
- 12 routes total: 6 MVP + assets + bgm + cuts/handoff + remotion preview/render/status.
- All workspace-scoped with status guards and usage ledger.

4. Implement UI screens
- `/` home: start CTA, BYOI CTA, recent projects.
- `/projects/:id/editor`: node canvas shell and stage actions.
- `/projects/:id/result`: artifact outputs and usage summary.

5. Align docs after each milestone
- Update together:
  - `PROJECT-STATUS.md`
  - `FEATURE-MATRIX.md`
  - `SCHEMA-INDEX.md` (if contract changed)

## Acceptance Checklist
- User can finish one full path:
  - create project -> select mode/BYOI -> cut edit handoff -> BGM analyze -> remotion preview -> render -> export
- Project status transitions are valid:
  - `draft -> generating -> generated -> exported` (+ failed path)
- Usage event is recorded on generation/render/export.

## Guardrails
- Do not open billing/team features before gate (`20+ real outputs`).
- Do not change status file names in `docs/status`.
- Do not break workspace scoping even in single-user mode.
