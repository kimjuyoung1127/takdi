# app/
Next.js App Router routes, pages, and API handlers.

## Structure
- `layout.tsx`: root layout
- `page.tsx`: home dashboard
- `projects/[id]/editor/page.tsx`: flow editor route
- `projects/[id]/compose/page.tsx`: compose editor route
- `projects/[id]/preview/page.tsx`: preview route
- `projects/[id]/result/page.tsx`: mode-aware result route
- `api/projects/`: project CRUD and async job routes
- `uploads/[...path]/route.ts`: upload file serving route

## API Notes
- `api/projects/[id]/thumbnail/`: shortform preview thumbnail generation
- `api/projects/[id]/marketing-script/`: shortform preview marketing-script generation
- Async API pattern stays `POST -> 202 + jobId`, `GET -> poll`

## Convention
- Keep page entry files server-first.
- Push heavy interaction into client components.
- Keep route contracts aligned with `docs/ref/SCHEMA-INDEX.md`.
